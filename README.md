> As a fizzbuzz user  
> I want a standalone shell script that will identify multiples of 3 and 5  
> So that I can output alternative data to my users

* Write a script called "fizzbuzz.sh" takes in integer as an input.
* If the input is a multiple of 3, print "fizz".
* If the input is a multiple of 5, print "buzz".
* If the input is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "fizzbuzz" instead.
* If the input is not a multiple of 3 or 5, print the input number.
* If the input is zero or negative, print nothing.
